# Course Notes

Various notes from courses (may be copy paste) -- remove from any final edition of the book.

Strategies range
from low-frequency, at least by trading
standards, to high-frequency. You must implement high-frequency
trading strategies with software and market
interfaces that can handle sub-millisecond order
creation and submission. Quant strategies
are also a type of forecasting method that
attempts to predict the future value of a stock or other instrument where
the direction of a price spread between
two instruments. These forecasts are based on an observed price response
to factors that you have identified as
statistically significant in predicting changes in
an instrument's price. Mean reversion strategies
depend on the stability or stationarity of an asset's price or spread relative
to another asset. When the price risk
spread gets too high, it becomes more likely
that it will decrease, and so revert to its long-term
mean or neutral value. When the price risk
spread gets too low, it becomes more likely
that it will increase, and again revert to its mean.


Equally important
is their ability to detect and profit
from the execution of large orders that have
been broken up and hidden using an order
execution strategy. Let's say a firm
wants to purchase an unusually large
quantity of stock. Now use an execution
strategy that enters the trades in a
way that is supposed to break up and hide the order but which unintentionally
signals search strategy. Sophisticated traders
have their own algorithms which are able to detect
these stealth orders. They're able to use
this information to jump in front of
the large orders, and profit by driving
prices up ahead of a buy order or down
ahead of a sell order. Spoofing is where traders
attempt to mislead other traders by submitting
orders to the market, order book that they
don't intend to execute. Say a trading group needs to sell a stock and wants to
get a better price. They can enter temporary
large-sized buy orders below the current market
bid to encourage other bidders to pay higher
prices for the stock.


**Risk of Trading**
