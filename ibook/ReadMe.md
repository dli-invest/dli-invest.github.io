* Risk of Returns
* Price Prediction (Practically useless for what I buy)
* Online Portoflio Selection (Just for Verification/Validation)
* Estimation of Returns

New Risk Page will be made for risk management per tag with useless price predictions
Periodic publishing for online portoflio selection and risk management for current portfolio.


#### TodoList

**06/13/2020**

* 

**06/07/2020**
* ~~Limit to 2 decimals make columns 6 instead of 3~~
* Append data to hardcoded csv (won't do, stocks will change too quickly)

#### SubReports

Github Pages with Specific Folder Report on Risk.
Generate risk with different holdings, append to different csvs based on settings.
Complex config.yml file?


**Disclaimer** Major non day trade purchases will be recorded here.

Note this will not be rolling, say I buy a stock
```
risk:
  -  stocks:
     weights:
     output_csv:
  -  stocks:
     weights:
     output_csv:
```

Will iterate across predicted images and show them in the report.

### Prophet
#### IEX API KEY

Need to set iex api key

This will be a html report generated and setup to have more or less statistics
